# Genetic Equation Solver

This project uses a genetic algorithm to approximate mathematical equations that best fit a set of target values. It explores different equation typesâ€”Quadratic, Exponential, and Cubicâ€”evolving a population of candidate solutions over generations using crossover and mutation.

## ðŸ§¬ How It Works

The core of this project is a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that evolves a population of `Equation` instances over many generations. Each `Equation` has a structure and a set of coefficients, and its "fitness" is determined by how well it matches a predefined set of input/output values:

```ruby
TARGET_VALUES = {
  0 => 0,
  0.91 => 90,
  0.46 => 26,
  0.37 => 12.2
}
```

Supported equation types:
- **Quadratic**: `y = a + bx + cxÂ²`
- **Exponential**: `y = a * e^(bx)`
- **Cubic**: `y = a + bx + cxÂ² + dxÂ³`

The goal is to evolve an equation whose output values closely match the target values above.

## ðŸš€ Running the Program

To run the program, execute the `bin/run` script:

```bash
bin/run
```

This script will:
1. Generate a random population of equations.
2. Evolve them over a specified number of generations.
3. Output the best-performing equation and its fitness.

The values used are:

```ruby
POPULATION_SIZE = 10000
GENERATIONS = 20000
```

You can adjust these to experiment with speed and precision.

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

The project uses [RSpec](https://rspec.info) for unit testing.

To run the tests:

```bash
bundle install
rspec
```

If you donâ€™t have bundler installed:

```bash
gem install bundler
```
